        # Aspose.OCR On-premises Micro App
        
        A fast and easy-to-use utility for optical character recognition from the Windows terminal, Linux console, batch files, PowerShell, or Bash scripts. Convert images to text without writing a single line of code and easily extend your automated workflows with OCR functionality.
        
        [Aspose.OCR technology](https://products.aspose.com/ocr/cpp/) | [Blog](https://blog.aspose.com/category/ocr/) | [Free Support](https://forum.aspose.com/c/ocr/16) | [Licensing](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) | [Documentation](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/cpp/)
        
        Aspose.OCR is a software development kit for optical character recognition. It allows you to add OCR functionality to your applications written in .NET, Java, C++, Python and JavaScript.
        
        This command-line utility powered by Aspose.OCR for C++ provides a quick and easy way to test our OCR engine without writing a single line of code. Simply run it from the Windows terminal or PowerShell console or include it to the batch file.
        
        Download the source code at https://github.com/aspose-ocr/Aspose.OCR-for-Cpp-Console/releases to familiarize yourself with the API and write your own applications quickly and easily.
        
        ## System requirements
        
        The utility was tested under the following operating systems:
        
        - Microsoft Windows 10 or above;
        - Microsoft Windows Server 2016 or above;
        - Ubuntu 20.04.
        
        The product package already includes all the necessary components and libraries. Do not move, rename or delete any files in it.
        
        ## Installation
        
        1. Download the latest version of the executable package for your operating system.
        2. Extract the archive to some folder on your machine.
        3. Run the utility from the command line or batch file.
        
        ## Licensing
        
        You can start using Aspose.OCR On-premises Micro App right after the installation. While the utility itself is distributed as an open-source under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/), the Aspose.OCR recognition engine has some restrictions:
        
        - If the number of characters in a recognized image exceeds 300, only the first 300 characters are recognized.
        - If the number of characters in a recognized image is less than 300, the first 60% of characters are recognized.
        
        Apply a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license) or [purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/pricing/ocr/cpp) a full license to remove the restrictions.
